# Predictive Stock Price Modeling using Time Series Analysis

This repository contains a predictive modeling project that focuses on forecasting stock prices using time series analysis. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, and optimization steps.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to predict stock prices using historical stock market data and time series analysis techniques. The goal is to build a predictive model that can provide accurate insights into future stock price movements. The project covers the following key aspects:

- Data Collection: Gathering historical stock price data from reliable sources.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features to enhance predictive power.
- Time Series Analysis: Decomposing data, handling temporal dependencies, and exploring seasonality and trends.
- Model Building: Training predictive models (e.g., Random Forest) to forecast stock prices.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Model Optimization: Fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve predictive accuracy.
- Visualization: Creating visualizations to understand data patterns and model results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-stock-model.git
cd predictive-stock-model

Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook Predictive_Stock_Modeling.ipynb.
Follow the step-by-step instructions to explore, preprocess, model, and evaluate the data.
Adjust hyperparameters and explore advanced techniques to optimize the model.
Results
After building and optimizing the model, we achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.160, indicating promising predictive performance.
